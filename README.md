# Clicky Game
This app is a memory game build with React.  The app will display images to the screen and ask the user to click each image only once.  Everytime an image is clicked,the images will shuffle and the user can continue to click images.

If the user clicks an image that has not been previously selected, then the score will increase.  If the user clicks an image that has already been chosen, the game will start over.  Each attempt will record a top score and update if the current score exceeds the top score.
